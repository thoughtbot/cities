# Moving to UK from overseas

Tips from our collective experience of moving to the UK.

If you're moving to the USA, [look here](/moving-to-usa.md).

* Visa
  * If you're working, you will most likely need one.
  * The [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration) all the info you need.
* Mobile number
  * [Three](https://www.three.co.uk) seems to have the best data deals, buy a pay-as-you-go sim and upgrade to a plan later.
* Bank account
  * We've had great success with [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), there is also [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/)
  * You will need a UK phone number and address, you can use the office address to deliver your card.
* National Insurance number (NI)
  * You can get an NI number if you are a UK resident.
  * If you're on a visa it should be on the back of your Biometric Residence Permit issued once you arrive, if it’s not, apply for one on the [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number).
  * If you're not on a visa, apply for one on the [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number).
* Travel
  * Until you have a contactless card in £, buy and use an Oyster card to save on the exchange rate.
  * Check the [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) website.
  * Once you have a contactless card (any modern bank card) you can use these on all transport in London: Tube, Bus, Overground etc
  * Download [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com) for getting around. It’s the most up to date with incidents and closures on the tube, and gives you cost estimates for each route it recommends.
* Accommodation resources
  * [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk) is great for short stays. Keep in mind London is generally quite busy.
  * [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk)
  * [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk)
  * [Butler & Stag](https://www.butlerandstag.uk)
  * Or a google around.

# Moving to UK from the EU

* Visa
  * Nothing is needed, as EU citizens are eligible to work in the UK.
  * However, chances are you won’t get a National Insurance number until you have actually relocated. You need to call and schedule an interview and this can only be done once you are in the UK. They will schedule the appointment for you and it should take a couple of weeks to happen.
  * It is possible to begin work without an NI number, provided you inform thoughtbot to use an emergency tax code on your payslip (more info [here](https://www.gov.uk/tax-codes/emergency-tax-codes)).
* Brexit
  * Yeah, we’re gonna have to check back on that one later ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
  * Truth is no one knows what is going to happen but, in theory:
    * There are 2 years acting as a transitional period where nothing changes.
    * There is a free movement of people and goods within the UK and the EU and this is expected to last until March 2021.
    * The default government position is expected to be to accept EU citizens living in the UK provided they can provide some day -- it is still currently not know which data, but it might range from having a work contract to having no criminal record.
* Mobile number
  * Same as the overseas section
* Bank account
  * The easiest option out there is probably [Monzo](https://monzo.com) since it is officially a bank in the UK. You just need to provide an address for your card to be delivered to.
  * If you don't have an address yet, feel free to use thoughtbot's. Just let the studio know beforehand
  * If Monzo isn't an option for you, there's also [Revolut](https://revolut.com) althought they are still in the process of acquiring a banking license.
  * In case you prefer a traditional bank, Lloyd's allows you to create an account using an EU ID card or passport, although these might be subject of higher fees.
* Accommodation
  * Probably your best bet is to stay at a friends' while you search for a flat yourself. You can also use Airbnb for this.
  * Try to book Airbnb early and if possible spend one or two weeks in London before moving, just to get flat viewings
  * [Spareroom](https://spareroom.co.uk) is a good place to start looking for potential flats and/or flatmates. It allows you to find other people to buddy up with and look for places. You can also make sure you share interests and lifestyle preferences with current households, if you are looking for a room in a flat with tenants in.
  * Some people are available for FaceTime/Skype viewings, which might be worth if you are not able to do viewings yourself, but bare in mind this is generally not the best option, as the landlords tend to prefer someone who is viewing in person.
  * [Rightmove](https://rightmove.co.uk) also provides good options but most listing belong to agencies, which has fees associated with.
* Credit score
  * Chances are if you are moving to the UK for the first time, you won't be able to get a credit score yet. This means that you might have a hard time getting contracts down without paying around 6 months in advance. Rent might be difficult to do so, 6 months in advance, so always be wary of letting agencies since they have a mandatory credit check.
* Other resources:
  * [r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki) - honestly, most of the stuff you will need to know in terms of the city are there. From things to do, places to hang out, safety guide, London zones guide, etc. It is very insightful and up to do date. It allows you to understand the city well and even get some tips on the relocation process.

That's it! Welcome to London! Stand on the right.
