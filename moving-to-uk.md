# Moving to UK from overseas

Tips from our collective experience of moving to the UK.

If you're moving to the USA, [look here](/moving-to-usa.md).

* Visa
  * If you're working, you will most likely need one.
  * The [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration) all the info you need.
* Mobile number
  * [Three](https://www.three.co.uk) seems to have the best data deals, buy a pay-as-you-go sim and upgrade to a plan later.
* Bank account
  * We've had great success with [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), there is also [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/)
  * You will need a UK phone number and address, you can use the office address to deliver your card.
* National Insurance number (NI)
  * You can get an NI number if you are a UK resident.
  * If you're on a visa it should be on the back of your Biometric Residence Permit issued once you arrive, if it’s not, apply for one on the [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number).
  * If you're not on a visa, apply for one on the [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number).
* Travel
  * Until you have a contactless card in £, buy and use an Oyster card to save on the exchange rate.
  * Check the [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) website.
  * Once you have a contactless card (any modern bank card) you can use these on all transport in London: Tube, Bus, Overground etc
  * Download [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com) for getting around. It’s the most up to date with incidents and closures on the tube, and gives you cost estimates for each route it recommends.
* Accommodation resources
  * [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk) is great for short stays. Keep in mind London is generally quite busy.
  * [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk)
  * [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk)
  * [Butler & Stag](https://www.butlerandstag.uk)
  * Or a google around.
