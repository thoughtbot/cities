Hotels
------

If you're coming from out of town and only need to stay a few nights, we
recommend these hotels:

Near the thoughtbot office, hip enough for a Rails developer:

* [The Nine Zero](http://www.ninezero.com/nnz-map/index.html)
* [The Onyx](http://www.onyxhotel.com)
* [The Charlesmark](http://www.thecharlesmark.com)
* [The Lenox](http://www.lenoxhotel.com)

Not as hip, but near thoughtbot, best for hotels.com points, etc.:

* [Marriott Long
  Wharf](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boslw-boston-marriott-long-wharf)

Near thoughtbot, fancy enough for a venture capitalist:

* [Park Plaza](http://www.bostonparkplaza.com)
* [Ritz
  Carlton](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/BostonCommon/Default.htm)
