Boston is a great place to found and run a web business. This is meant to be a

Where can you meet other folks in the Boston tech community?

All links go to Google Maps for easy discovery on your phone.

Hotels

If you're coming from out of town and only need to stay a few nights, we
recommend these hotels:

Near the thoughtbot office, hip enough for a Rails developer:

* [The Nine Zero](http://www.ninezero.com/nnz-map/index.html)
* [The Onyx](http://www.onyxhotel.com)
* [The Charlesmark](http://www.thecharlesmark.com)
* [The Lenox](http://www.lenoxhotel.com)

Not as hip, but near thoughtbot, best for hotels.com points, etc.:

* [Marriott Long
  Wharf](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boslw-boston-marriott-long-wharf)

Near thoughtbot, fancy enough for a venture capitalist:

* [Park Plaza](http://www.bostonparkplaza.com)
* [Ritz
  Carlton](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/BostonCommon/Default.htm)
